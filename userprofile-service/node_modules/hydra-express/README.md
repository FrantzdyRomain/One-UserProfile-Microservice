Hydra-Express is a light-weight library for building NodeJS and ExpressJS based distributed computing applications. It was announced at [EmpireNode 2016](http://empirenode.org/).

Hydra offers features such as service discovery, distributed messaging, message load balancing, logging, presence, and health monitoring.
