Hydra is a NodeJS package which facilitates building distributed applications such as Microservices.

Hydra offers features such as service discovery, distributed messaging, message load balancing, logging, presence, and health monitoring. It was announced at [EmpireNode 2016](http://empirenode.org/).

Install the latest stable version via `npm install hydra --save`

[See our quick start guide](https://www.hydramicroservice.com/docs/quick-start/) and [sample projects](https://www.hydramicroservice.com/resources/#resources)

If you're just getting started with Node Microservices and you have ExpressJS experience you should first look at our [HydraExpress](https://github.com/flywheelsports/hydra-express) project.

> If you want a lighter-weight Express integration or you're using Hapi, Koa, Sails.js, Restify or Restana then checkout the [Hydra Integration Project](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hydra-integration).
